# HackersPoulette

Welcome to my repository, I am a junior web developer in training at Be/Code and I am currently learning about how to deal with sql database and php pages. This repository contains my exercises about this matter and will be updated according to my exploration of the database and languages. This repository was first started on January 30th 2023.

# Who Am I

I'm a junior developer currently in intensive bootcamp at BeCode Charleroi and do these exercices as part of my training.

# What will you find inside this repository ?

You will find php files, and some files related to the utilisation of Tailwind framework.

# How to use it ?

To use the form, you will need a local server or a distant server and a sql database.




Note : there is actually a problem on deploying with Vercel... working on it !
